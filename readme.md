# BikeBuddy Mobile App

BikeBudy is a standalone kit to upgrade a normal pedal bicycle to a smart bike capable of tracking, displaying, and storing basic fitness metrics including distance, speed, and heart rate. The BikeBuddy also includes a mobile application that can connect via Bluetooth to transfer, store, and display a user's data collected during the ride.

This was my first experience building a mobile application and was a lot of fun. I learned much through development primarily working in Java through Android Studio. The BikeBuddy hardware and app were built as a prototype for a potential future product as part of my team's Senior Design project. My team consisted of myself, Tomohisa Shinagawa, Michael Srinivasen, and Kevin Zhang with my primary contribution as the main software engineer being the mobile app. 

Future improvements include more means of data transmission, improved UI experience, iOS development, better graphical display, integration with other software suites, and much more.
