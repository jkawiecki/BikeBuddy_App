# BikeBuddy Mobile App

The BikeBudy is a standalone kit to upgrade a normal pedal bicycle into a smart bike capable of tracking, storing, and displaying basic fitness metrics including distance, speed, and heart rate. The BikeBuddy also includes a mobile application that can connect via Bluetooth to transfer, store, and display a user's data collected during the ride.

This was my first experience building a mobile application and was a lot of fun. I learned much through development primarily working in Java with Android Studio. The BikeBuddy hardware and app were built as a prototype for a potential future product as part of a Senior Design project. The team consisted of Joseph Kawiecki (me), Tomohisa Shinagawa, Michael Srinivasen, and Kevin Zhang. As the main software engineer, my primary contribution was designing and building the mobile app. 

Future improvements include greater means of data transmission, improved UI experience, iOS development, better graphical display, integration with other software, and much more.
